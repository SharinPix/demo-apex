# GPS coordinates associated with images

This demo is deployed for Contact objects and shows the GPS coordinates of the currently viewed image. 

The [`e.originalEvent.data`](https://github.com/SharinPix/demo-apex/blob/gps/src/pages/SharinPixDemoGps.page#L10) variable contains more metadata based on the event being fired, should you need to manipulate any other metadata.
