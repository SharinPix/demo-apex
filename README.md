# Upload attachments to SharinPix (Email-to-Case)

Once deployed, this demo will add a trigger to all newly created attachments on Salesforce cases. 

A possible use case for this demo is automatically uploading received attachments from emails (when using Email-to-Case) to the SharinPix album for the related case.

Feel free to use the code provided in the [SharinPixDemoEmail2CaseAttachmentHandler](src/classes/SharinPixDemoEmail2CaseAttachmentHandler.cls) class to upload existing attachments to your SharinPix album.
