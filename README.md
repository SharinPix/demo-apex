## Explaining the gravity parameters options

### Gravity

* Face - Automatically detects the largest face in an image and aims to make it the center of the cropped image. Alternatively, use face coordinates specified by API if available. Defaults to the 'north' gravity if no face was detected.

* face:center - Same as the 'face' gravity, but defaults to 'center' gravity instead of 'north' if no face is detected.

* faces:auto - Same as the 'faces' gravity, but defaults to 'auto' gravity instead of 'north' if no faces are detected.

* body:face - Automatically detect the largest body in an image and aim to make it the center of the cropped image. Defaults to the 'face' gravity if a full body was not detected

* custom:face - Same as the 'custom' gravity, but defaults to 'face' gravity if no custom coordinates are available.

* custom:faces - Same as the 'custom' gravity, but defaults to 'faces' gravity if no custom coordinates are available.

* custom:adv_face - Same as the 'custom' gravity, but defaults to 'adv_face' gravity if no custom coordinates are available.

* custom:adv_faces	- Same as the 'custom' gravity, but defaults to 'adv_faces' gravity if no custom coordinates are available.
