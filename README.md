# Download a PDF file from SharinPix within a Visualforce Page in the Salesforce IOS App

## Objective
The objective of this demo is to enable the download of a PDF file from SharinPix when it is viewed on Salesforce App on an IOS device. When a file with extension `.pdf`, is viewed within the SharinPix Album, a download link is activated and gives the ability to the user to save the PDf file on the device.

For an insight into how to implement the above method, access the SharinPix Cookbook documentation.
