# Manage delete permission with Tag

## Objective
A tag has the possibility of granting or restricting a permission on a given image. In this demo, we will see how it is possible to allow images, with a particular tag, to be deleted. 
In this context, we will use a tag named delete, to allow the deletion of an image, while images without the delete tag cannot be deleted.

For an insight into how to implement the above method, access the SharinPix Cookbook documentation.
