# Webhook site

This demo consists of an example Visualforce page and its associated Apex controller, which are used to handle webhook calls from SharinPix.

Make the Visualforce page available as a Salesforce Site and then set up a webhook on the SharinPix administration dashboard with its URL. Whenever an event occurs that in included in the webhook configuration, SharinPix will send a request to the URL set up.
