# Dynamically assign tags based on Record Type

## Purpose

This demo will illustrate the possibility to integrate a single Visualforce Page(embedded with the SharinPix app) along with its specific sets of Tag labels corresponding  to the correct Record Type. These Tags will be dynamically assigned depending on which Record Type the Visualforce Page is currently on. This feauture proves invaluable as it removes the need to have a Visualforce Page for each Record Type and thus reduces repetition.
